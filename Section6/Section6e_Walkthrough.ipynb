    "## 1. Introduce Dataset and Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to be using a Kaggle dataset called [\"Personal Key Indicators of Heart Disease\"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset consists of 2020 annual CDC survey data from 400,000 adults related to their health status with regard to heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we provide an edited description of the data, taken from the Kaggle data description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What topic does the dataset cover?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the USA (African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and white people). About half of all Americans (47%) have at least 1 of 3 key risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking. Other key indicators include diabetic status, obesity (high BMI), not getting enough physical activity or drinking too much alcohol. \n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting and preventing the factors that have the greatest impact on heart disease is very important in healthcare. Computational developments allow the application of machine learning methods to detect \"patterns\" from the data that can predict a patient's condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where did the dataset come from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, the dataset came from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. The dataset we are using includes data from 2020. The original dataset consists of 401,958 rows and 279 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The vast majority of columns are questions asked to respondents about their health status, such as \"Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs?\" or \"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset available for this course includes just a small set of the most relevant variables for heart disease risk (from a theoretical/medical perspective). The original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to just about 20 variables, for computational tractability for this course. It has also undergone some basic cleaning so that it would be usable for machine learning projects, such as dealing with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What can you do with this dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset can be used to apply a range of machine learning methods, most notably classifier models since the target variable \"HeartDisease\" is binary (\"Yes\" - respondent had heart disease; \"No\" - respondent had no heart disease). \n",
    "\n",
    "We note that classes are not balanced, so the classic model application approach is not advisable. Fixing the weights/stratified sampling should yield significantly better results. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "The features available in the dataset are shown in the table below. The first variable, **HeartDisease**, is the target variable. We aim to predict whether **HeartDisease** is true or false. \n",

    "The exploratory data analysis (EDA) suggests nearly all the features correlate with the target variable; this should not be surprising as they were specifically chosen from a larger dataset because they might be relevant for predicting heart disease. This would not be true in other cases, when EDA could help you sort through a larger set of features to identify a possible subset for modeling. \n",

Might it vary in some way across the distribution of the feature? Might it vary based on values of another feature? Such findings can inform your feature engineering.\n",

    "Feature engineering is at the heart of machine learning, and there's no single way to do it. **Feature engineering** is the process of constructing new features that we think might be informative about the predictor variable.

These are all steps we take *prior* to fitting a model in order to make the data more suitable for prediction.\n",

Specifically, it's an **ensemble model**, since it consists of an ensemble of $N$ decision trees. The $N$ trees in the forest can separately make predictions, each of which counts as a vote toward the final prediction.

    "- Instead, the trees are trained on a subset (usually a random 2/3) of the features and a bootstrapped (sampled with replacement) sample of the data. This helps reduce the variance of the predictions. *Bagging* (Bootstrap aggregating) estimates $N$ trees on bootstrapped samples with the same features. Random forests have a second parameter that controls how many features to try when finding the best split. Common rules of thumb for determining this parameter when there are $p$ features are $\\sqrt{p}$ and $p/3$.\n",

    "\n",
    "eXtreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, is currently (as of early 2026) the gold standard to supervised machine learning with structured or tabular data. It is incredibly fast and highly accurate relative to other classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost is part of the evolution of decision tree models:\n",
    "1. Decision Tree: A single \"flowchart\" making decisions. High variance (overfits easily).\n",
    "2. Random Forest (Bagging): Builds many trees independently and averages them.\n",
    "3. Gradient Boosting (Boosting): Builds trees sequentially. Each new tree tries to fix the specific errors (residuals) made by the previous trees.\n",
    "4. XGBoost: A highly optimized version of Gradient Boosting that adds clever math to prevent overfitting and specialized engineering to run extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes XGBoost \"eXtreme\"? The main advantage is **regularization**. Standard boosting can be \"too aggressive\" and memorize noise. XGBoost includes L1 and L2 regularization (as we saw with Lasso and Ridge models) directly in its objective function. This penalizes complex trees, forcing the model to stay simple and generalize better.\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost also has some additional nice features. First, it has a Sparsity-Aware Split Finding algorithm to deal with missing values. If a value is missing, the model \"tries\" sending it to the left branch and the right branch, then learns which direction works best for that specific feature. This replaces manual imputation, though that can still be useful as well. Second, it is very fast. XGBoost is designed to utilize all the cores of a student's CPU simultaneously (parallel processing). It also uses \"Cache Awareness,\" meaning it organizes data in the computer's memory so the processor can grab it instantly without waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost has dozens of parameters you can set and tune. For this introduction, we'll focus just on a few \"big ones\":\n",
    "* `n_estimators`: Number of trees to build. Too many = overfitting; too few = underfitting.\n",
    "* `learning_rate` (eta): How much we \"listen\" to each new tree. Usually between 0.01 and 0.3. Smaller values require more n_estimators.\n",
    "* `max_depth`: How deep each individual tree can go. Standard is 3–6. Deep trees capture complex patterns but overfit quickly.\n",
    "* `subsample`: Percentage of rows used to train each tree. Helps prevent the model from focusing too much on specific outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estimating an XGBoost model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the `xgboost` package. Fortunately, the syntax is very similar to `scikit-learn`. We'll estimate a basic model here with some specific selected parameters. Click on \"Parameters\" after estimating to see what else we might have specified."

For multiclass classification there are `mlogloss` and `merror` multiclass versions of the binary metrics. For regression, `rmse` and `mae` are common, as we used in our linear regression models."

    "### Moving beyond the basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand the basic \"Fit and Predict\" process, here are the four areas you could look into to become more proficient with XGBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the **Bias-Variance Tradeoff**\n",
    "Tuning in XGBoost is a balancing act:\n",
    "* To reduce Overfitting (High Variance): Lower max_depth, increase gamma (minimum loss reduction to split), or decrease learning_rate.\n",
    "* To reduce Underfitting (High Bias): Increase max_depth or increase n_estimators.\n",
    "Grid search hyperparameter tuning can help with setting values, but it is important to have a strong conceptual understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Early Stopping**\n",
    "Instead of picking a random number for n_estimators, you can tell XGBoost: \"Keep building trees until the validation score stops improving for 10 rounds, then stop.\" This saves time and prevents overfitting perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Feature Engineering** over Tuning\n",
    "Better data beats a better model. Spending two hours tuning hyperparameters usually yields a 1% improvement. Spending two hours creating a new, clever feature (like interactions between dummy variables, squared continuous variables, etc.) can yield a 5–10% improvement. This point holds for all supervised ML, not just XGBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. XGBoost for **Regression**\n",
    "XGBoost can also be used to predict continuous numbers by simply using XGBRegressor instead of XGBClassifier. The logic and hyperparameters remain nearly identical. It can produce efficiency gains relative to alternatives such as Lasso or Ridge Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, here are some basic **troubleshooting notes:**\n",
    "* Model is too slow: Decrease n_estimators or increase learning_rate.\n",
    "* Model is memorizing the training data: Decrease max_depth or use subsample (e.g., 0.8).\n",
    "* Classes are imbalanced (e.g., rare disease): Use scale_pos_weight to give the rare class more \"weight.\"\n",
    "* The computer is getting hot/loud: Set n_jobs=-1 to ensure it's using all CPU cores efficiently."
