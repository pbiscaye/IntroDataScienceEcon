    "#### What is a raster?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Raster files** are images built from pixels — tiny color squares that, in great quantity, can form highly detailed images such as photographs. The more pixels an image has for a fixed area, the higher quality it will be, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Raster files can include many different extensions but all include the same basic type of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a raster is a spatial object we can map the locations of the pixels in the image to locations on a map or grid, and use the information in each pixel (which may have several layers) to plot spatial information."

    "* TIFF: Tagged Image File Format for storing raster graphics images.\n",
    "* GeoTIFF: TIFF file with georeferencing information embedded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most `.tif` files we use in spatial analysis are GeoTIFF files. You can view them as a simple image (as with non-spatial TIFFs), but they embed scientific datasets. When you open a `.tif` in a standard image viewer, it might looks like a dark or grey mess. That is because image viewers are not built to interpret the content of these files, with the exception of the most simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a GeoTIFF file as a collection of actual rasters (we will later deal with them as `numpy.ndarray`) and a collection of metadata that contains georeferencing information. The rasters hold different values for every pixel in the grid. The separate rasters are referred to as **bands**. A given GeoTIFF can have dozens of these, whereas a standard photo only has 3 (RGB). The potential **metadata** information includes map projection, coordinate systems, pixel size, and everything else necessary to establish the exact spatial reference for the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "GeoTIFFs have advantages over other image formats (like JPEG) such as lossless compression and including transparent \"NoData\" values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be using data from the [Gridded Population of the World data set](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-count-rev11) produced by a team at Columbia University. We'll be using the version provided at a 15 arcminute or a 0.25 degree resolution (about 30km). Much higher resolution versions are available, but this low-resolution version will make computation much faster for training purposes. This version of the dataset describes the total number of individuals that are estimated to have lived in each grid cell in the year 2000."
