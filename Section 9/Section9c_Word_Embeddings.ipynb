    "#### Instructor: Pierre Biscaye \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third of three notebooks covering the foundations for performing **text analysis** in Python. In the previous parts, we learned how to perform text preprocessing and convert text into numeric representations with Bags of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF. These methods make heavy use of word frequency but not much of the relative positions between words, but there's still rich semantic (relating to language or logic) and syntactic (relating to structure) meanings left to be captured beyond independent frequencies of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "We need a more powerful tool that has the potential to represent rich semantics (and more) of our text data. In the final part of this series, we will dive into word embeddings, a method widely combined with more advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. We'll make extensive use of the `gensim` package, which hosts a range of word embedding models, including `word2vec` and `glove`, the two models we'll explore today.\n",

Oftentimes the cell values are zeros: many words do not simply appear in a particular document. \n",

    "We can think of word embedding as a matrix likewise, but this time a **dense** matrix, where the cell values are real numbers. Word embeddings project a word's meaning onto a high-dimensional vector space, which is why it is also called **word vectors**. A word vector is essentially an array of real numbers, the length of which, as we'll see today, could be as low as 50, or as high as 300 (or even higher in Large Language Models). These real number vectors do not make explicit sense to us, but capture aspects of semantic or syntactic meanings of words.  \n",

    "## `word2vec`\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into `word2vec`, let's talk a bit of history first. The idea of word vectors, i.e, projecting a word's meaning onto a vector space, has been around for a long time. The `word2vec` model, proposed by [Mikolov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546) in 2013, introduces an efficient model of word embeddings. Since then it has stimulated a new wave of research into this topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key question asked in the 2013 paper is: how do we go about learning a good vector representation from the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mikolov et al. proposed two approaches: the **continuous bag-of-words (CBOW)** and the **skip-gram (SG)**. Both are similar in that we use the vector representation of a token to try and predict what the nearby tokens are with a shallow neural network.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Take the following sentence for example. If our target token is $w_t$, \"banks\", the context tokens would be the preceding tokens $w_{t-2}, w_{t-1}$ and the following ones $w_{t+1}, w_{t+2}$. This corresponds to a **window size** of 2: 2 words on either side of the target word. Similarly when we move onto the next target token, the context window (tokens underlined) moves as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='Images/target_word.png' alt=\"Target word\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the continuous bag-of-words model, the goal is to predict the target token, given the context tokens. In the skip-gram model, the task is to predict the context tokens from the target token. This is the reverse of the continuous bag-of-words, and is a harder task, since we have to predict more from less information.\n",

The input and output are known to us, represented by **one-hot encodings** in Mikolov et al. The **hidden layer**, the inner dimension in-between the input and the output, is the vector representation that we are trying to find out. \n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into the specifics of training but provide a brief idea of where does embedding come from. The `word2vec` model we will be interacting with today is **pretrained**, meaning that the embeddings have already been trained on a large corpus (or a number of corpora).
