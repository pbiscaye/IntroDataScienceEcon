    "# Section 9. Text Analysis Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructor: Pierre Biscaye \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the first of three notebooks covering the foundations for performing **text analysis** in Python. These techniques lie in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a field that deals with identifying and extracting patterns of language, primarily in written texts. We will cover a variety of basic text analysis tasks using both built-in python string methods as well as specific NLP packages, such as `nltk`, `spaCy`, and more recent ones on Large Language Models (`transformers`).\n",

    "1. Preprocessing: Apply common steps for preprocessing text data, applied to the cae of Twitter data.\n",

    "# 1. Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of text analysis is to convert the raw, messy text data into a consistent format. Doing so ensures that the text data preserves the necessary information for subsequent analysis while stripping away less relevant details. This process is often called **preprocessing**, **text cleaning**, or **text normalization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice that at the end of preprocessing, our data is still in a format that we can read and understand - it remains 'text.' In Parts 2 and 3, we will begin our foray into converting the text data into numerical representations â€” formats that can be more readily handled by computers. "

    "## Common Processes\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocessing is not something we can accomplish in one swoop with a single line of code. We often start by familiarizing ourselves with the data, and along the ways we become clearer about the granularity of preprocessing we need to do. We must also think about our analysis objectives, as this will guide the processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the objective, we typically begin with a set of commonly-used processes to clean the data. These operations will not substantially alter the form or meaning of the data; instead, they help us to convert the text data into a standard format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following processes, for example, are commonly applied to preprocess texts of various genres. Many of these operations can be done with built-in Python functions, such as `string` methods and Regular Expressions. \n",
    "- *Lowercase* the text\n",
    "- Remove *punctuation* marks\n",
    "- Remove extra *whitespace* characters\n",
    "- Remove *stop words* (these will be specific to each language)\n",
    "- *Stemming/lemmatization* (also language-specific)\n",
    "\n",
    "Afterwards, we may choose to perform task-specific cleaning processes, the specifics of which are dependent on the task we want to perform later and the source from which we retrieve our data at the first place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many of these tasks can/should be done after tokenization. The order of operations for preprocessing can have significant effects on what your cleaned text data look like.\n",

    "## Tokenizers Since LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've seen what tokenization looks like with two widely-used NLP packages. They work quite well in some settings, but not others. Recall that NLTK struggles with URLs for example. Now, imagine the data we have is even messier, containing misspellings, recently coined words, foreign names, etc, (collectively called \"out of vocabulary\" or OOV words). In such circumstances, we might need a more powerful model to handle these complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, tokenization schemes have changed substantially with **Large Language Models** (LLMs), which are models trained on a vast amount of data from mixed sources and linguistic genres. With that magnitude of data, LLMs are become better at chunking a longer sequence into tokens and tokens into **subtokens**. Subtokens could be morphological units of a word, such as a prefix, but they could also be parts of a word where the model sets a \"meaningful\" boundary. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will demonstrate tokenization using **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which utilizes a tokenization algorithm called [**WordPiece**](https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/en/chapter6/6). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will load the tokenizer of BERT from the package `transformers`, which hosts a number of Transformer-based LLMs (e.g., GPT-2). We will not go into the architecture of Transformer in this section, but the D-lab workshop on [GPT Fundamentals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/GPT-Fundamentals) may be a helpful place to start if you are interested in learningmore."
