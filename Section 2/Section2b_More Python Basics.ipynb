    "* When we write `n = 300`, we are assigning 300 to the variable `n` via the assignment operator `=`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data types** are classifications of data. \n",
    "* There are a lot of data types in Python, such as integers (`int`) and strings (`str`).\n",
    "* Some data types are called **data structures** because they allow us to organize data. Lists (`list`) and dictionaries (`dict`) are two examples.\n",
    "* You can index a list using square brackets, for instance `some_list[0]` to get the first item from `some_list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** perform actions on \"things\".\n",
    "* `print()` `len()`, and `type()` are some of the most commonly used functions.\n",
    "* You can identify a function by its trailing round parentheses.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments** are the \"things\" we perform the action on within a function.\n",
    "* Arguments go inside the trailing parentheses of functions when we call them. \n",
    "* For instance, in `print('CERDI')`, the string `CERDI` is an argument.\n",
    "* Arguments are also called inputs or **parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods** are type-specific functions.\n",
    "* Different data types and structures have functions that only apply to them.\n",
    "* For instance, strings have methods that only apply to them (lowercasing, uppercasing, etc.) that won't work with other data types.\n",
