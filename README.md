# Introduction to Data Science for Economists

This site hosts materials for my Data Science for Development Economics course at the Universit√© Clermont Auvergne. See the [Syllabus](https://github.com/pbiscaye/IntroDataScienceEcon/blob/main/Syllabus_Biscaye_DataScience.pdf) for an overview of the course's organization, and below for the course outline. Contact me at <pierre.biscaye@uca.fr> for more information.

All code applications in this course use Python. Follow the [course setup guide](https://github.com/pbiscaye/IntroDataScienceEcon/blob/main/Data_Science_Class_Setup_Guide.pdf) for instructions on getting set up to work in Python if you are new. If you are a more experienced user, skip to the section indicating what packages are used in the course.
