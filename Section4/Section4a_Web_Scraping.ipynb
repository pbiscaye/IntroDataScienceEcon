    "1. Extracting and parsing HTML using Beautiful Soup\n",
    "2. Understand difference between tags, attributes, and attribute values\n",

    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "When we'd like to access data from the web, we first have to make sure if the website we are interested in offers a Web API. Platforms like Twitter, Reddit, and the New York Times offer APIs. In the next notebook we provide an introduction to using APIs using the NY Times API as a case study.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are often cases when a Web API does not exist. In these cases, we may have to resort to web scraping, where we extract the underlying HTML from a web page, and directly obtain the information we want. There are several packages in Python we can use to accomplish these tasks. We'll focus two packages: Requests and Beautiful Soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first case study will be scraping information on the [World Bank Development Impact Job Market Blogs](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/impactevaluations/wrap-up-of-job-market-series-2025). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, let's peruse the link and view the page source to take a look at the structure of the blogs. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question**: What do you observe, both about the structure of the web pages and about the structure of the URLs?"

       "<p><b>Why Small Retailers Avoid Risk</b></p>\n",
       "<p>In 2020, a major Kenyan motorcycle importer invested over USD $3 million in a new factory to produce effective motorcycle helmets near Nairobi. The factory produces one of the first helmets that delivers meaningful safety benefits to the wearer (it complies with Kenya’s safety standards) while still being affordable to a typical household.

       "<p> <b>Experiment 1: Testing Whether Firms Are Risk Averse</b></p>\n",
       "<p>The first experiment, the Insurance Experiment, directly tested whether firms behave as if they are risk averse. I offered 350 small retailers in western Kenya the chance to buy helmet stock either with or without an insurance contract. If firms purchased helmet stock and then failed to sell out by a follow-up survey, they received a payment to offset some of their losses. The contract was designed to isolate whether firms are risk averse: under risk neutrality, it was strictly dominated—it lowered expected profits but reduced downside risk. Both treated and control firms were aware of the contract and its random assignment so that receipt of insurance did not send a signal to treated shops, and shops were not permitted to restock if they accepted the insurance payout so that the contract would not undermine incentives to sell out. <br/> <br/> If firms were risk neutral, insurance shouldn’t matter.

The results were not driven by new or flailing firms: longer tenured and larger enterprises also exhibited large responses to the insurance contract. </p>\n",

       "<p>The Insurance Experiment indicates that risk aversion affects firms’ stocking decisions. But is this because helmets are new, and does this matter for longer-run productivity? The second experiment, the Learning Experiment, followed 929 Nairobi retailers who had long known about the new helmets but still hesitated to sell them. I offered two randomly assigned treatments to test if risk aversion prevents retailers from engaging in new product experimentation required to learn about profitable new goods.</p>\n",
       "<p>In the first treatment, I temporarily offered some shops a returns policy: they could send back unsold helmets for a refund. During this first phase, adoption jumped from 6.8% to 16.4%, a 240% increase.</p>\n",
       "<p>The real test came later. Once the return option expired and all firms faced the same risk, the previously treated shops remained 70% more likely to stock helmets. They had learned that the product was profitable—and kept selling it. Firms reported that this helped them expand their business profitability: with the average adopter reporting that selling helmets made their shop about 10% more profitable by the endline survey, with most firms reporting plans to expand how much they stock.</p>\n",
       "<p>Could these persistent effects simply be because shops failed to account for the learning value of trying out helmet sales in their stocking decisions? I test this through a second experimental arm, the supplier commitment, that raised the value of learning without affecting short-run profits. I committed to help treated shops restock from the supplier when the study ended (many expressed concerns that they would be unable to do so without help), ensuring that shops could continue selling helmets if they found them profitable. This increase in the future value of information increased upfront stocking by 80%, showing that low helmet experimentation was not simply a result of firm myopia. Another possible story is that shops could have simply underestimated helmet profitability. But I show that the beliefs of shops induced to try stocking by the return policy were optimistic but uncertain, and experience in the market resolved their uncertainty about profitability but did not change mean profit expectations.</p>\n",
       "<p>Taken together, these results indicate that the return policy caused shops deterred from trying to stock helmets by risk aversion to experiment, who then overcame uncertainty with experience and no longer viewed stocking as risky. The results indicate a permanent change in the production function of complying retailers that helped them grow.</p>\n",
       "<p><b>Policy Lessons</b></p>\n",
       "<p> The evidence shows that risk aversion itself—independent of credit or information constraints—can trap firms in low-growth equilibria. Three lessons emerge:</p>\n",
       "<p>1.       Temporary risk-reduction policies can have permanent effects.</p>\n",
       "<p>2.       Insurance for experimentation can be highly cost-effective.</p>\n",
       "<p>3.       Uncertainty about the profitability of new products can prevent their retail diffusion even when they are demanded and available.</p>\n",
       "<p>Temporary interventions that lower the cost of experimentation can unlock lasting growth, even without changing long-run fundamentals.</p>\n",

I offered two randomly assigned treatments to test if risk aversion prevents retailers from engaging in new product experimentation required to learn about profitable new goods.\\nIn the first treatment, I temporarily offered some shops a returns policy: they could send back unsold helmets for a refund. During this first phase, adoption jumped from 6.8% to 16.4%, a 240% increase.\\nThe real test came later. Once the return option expired and all firms faced the same risk, the previously treated shops remained 70% more likely to stock helmets. They had learned that the product was profitable—and kept selling it. Firms reported that this helped them expand their business profitability: with the average adopter reporting that selling helmets made their shop about 10% more profitable by the endline survey, with most firms reporting plans to expand how much they stock.\\nCould these persistent effects simply be because shops failed to account for the learning value of trying out helmet sales in their stocking decisions? I test this through a second experimental arm, the supplier commitment, that raised the value of learning without affecting short-run profits. I committed to help treated shops restock from the supplier when the study ended (many expressed concerns that they would be unable to do so without help), ensuring that shops could continue selling helmets if they found them profitable. This increase in the future value of information increased upfront stocking by 80%, showing that low helmet experimentation was not simply a result of firm myopia. Another possible story is that shops could have simply underestimated helmet profitability. But I show that the beliefs of shops induced to try stocking by the return policy were optimistic but uncertain, and experience in the market resolved their uncertainty about profitability but did not change mean profit expectations.\\nTaken together, these results indicate that the return policy caused shops deterred from trying to stock helmets by risk aversion to experiment, who then overcame uncertainty with experience and no longer viewed stocking as risky. The results indicate a permanent change in the production function of complying retailers that helped them grow.\\nPolicy Lessons\\n The evidence shows that risk aversion itself—independent of credit or information constraints—can trap firms in low-growth equilibria. Three lessons emerge:\\n1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Temporary risk-reduction policies can have permanent effects.\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Insurance for experimentation can be highly cost-effective.\\n3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Uncertainty about the profitability of new products can prevent their retail diffusion even when they are demanded and available.\\nTemporary interventions that lower the cost of experimentation can unlock lasting growth, even without changing long-run fundamentals.'"
